ODNet : Asteroid Occultation Detection Convolutional Neural Network

This repository is for codes and models used in the following paper: 
[ODNet: A Convolutional Neural Network for Asteroid Occultation Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Description 

* Codes include models for occultation detection
* Models were developed and trained using TensorFlow version 2.4
* Pre-trained model is available by loading the "ODNet_trained" folder  

## Models:

* Needs an input of shape (2,20,32,32) and returns a float from 0 to 1 (0 means no occultation and 1 means occultation detected)

## Data 
* Training and test data are not available yet
